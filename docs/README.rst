WhichFile
=========

Basic Operation:
----------------

This is a combination of the ``which`` and ``file`` commands. It will
follow symlinks, reporting each link on the way, and then use
``libmagic`` to tell you what type of file it is. If you happen to be
using ``BASH``, this commands offers some of the same features as the
``type`` command, only prettier. Also,
`findfunc <https://github.com/welbornprod/findfunc>`__ is installed so
any bash functions that is finds will be syntax highlighted. On
``apt``-based systems it will use the ``CommandNotFound`` module to show
installable packages for missing commands.

Example:
~~~~~~~~

Determine where ``rlogin`` is linked, and what type of file it is:

::

    whichfile rlogin

Output:
^^^^^^^

::

    /usr/bin/rlogin:
        -> /etc/alternatives/rlogin
            -> /usr/bin/slogin
                -> /usr/bin/ssh
                    Type: ELF 64-bit LSB  shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=2d691144f816b05319ba27679df4b847107b99d7, stripped

This means that ``rlogin`` links to ``/etc/alternatives/rlogin``, which
links to ``slogin``, and finally ``ssh``.

Extended operation for BASH users:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an executable binary can't be found, it will look for an
alias/function in ``~/bash.alias.sh`` or ``~/.bash_aliases``.

Example:
^^^^^^^^

Determine whether ``ll`` is a BASH function or alias:

::

    whichfile ll

Output:
'''''''

::

    /home/cj/bash.alias.sh:
        -> ll
            -> alias ll="ls -alh --group-directories-first --color=always" # Long list dir

This means that ``ll`` is an alias in ``~/bash.alias.sh``.

Extended operation for CommandNotFound-enabled systems:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If all of that fails, and you have ``CommandNotFound`` installed
(pre-installed on debian-based machines) it will look for a package
containing the executable, and suggest install instructions.

Example:
^^^^^^^^

Determine whether ``mess`` is an installed executable:

::

    whichfile mess

Output:
'''''''

::

    There were errors resolving 1 path, 1 is installable.

        The program 'mess' is currently not installed.
            You can install it by typing: sudo apt install mess

This means that the ``mess`` executable cannot be found, but is
installable through the ``mess`` package.

    Usage:
        whichfile -h | -p | -v
        whichfile PATH... [-b | -B] [-c] [-D] [-N] [-s]
        whichfile PATH... [-d | -m] [-c] [-D] [-N] [-s]

    Options:
        PATH             : Directory path or paths to resolve.
        -b,--builtins    : Only show builtins when another binary exists.
        -B,--nobuiltins  : Don't check BASH builtins.
        -c,--ignorecwd   : Ignore files in the CWD, and try $PATH instead.
        -d,--dir         : Print the parent directory of the final target.
                           This enables --nobuiltins.
        -D,--debug       : Print some debugging info.
        -h,--help        : Show this help message.
        -m,--mime        : Show mime type instead of human readable form.
                           This enables --nobuiltins.
        -N,--debugname   : Shows bash alias/function lines that don't match
                           a function/alias pattern, but were found in the
                           line. This is for debugging `whichfile` itself.
        -p,--path        : List directories in $PATH, like:
                           echo "$PATH" | tr ':' '\n'
        -s,--short       : Short output, print only the target.
                           On error nothing is printed and non-zero is
                           returned.
                           Broken symlinks will be prepended with 'dead:'.
        -v,--version     : Show version.

Installation:
-------------

Pip:
~~~~

**whichfile** is a PyPi package, and can be installed with pip:

.. code:: bash

    pip install whichfile

This will create a ``whichfile`` executable that you can run.

Git:
~~~~

You can also clone the repo and do a manual install:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/welbornprod/whichfile.git

    cd whichfile
    python3 setup.py install --user

Demo:
-----

This is a recording of several runs, showing WhichFile's output for the
various types it can handle. Error output was included to show how
installable ``apt`` packages are handled.
